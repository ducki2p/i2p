There are a few changes in this package from upstream.

- eepget and i2prouter are installed to /usr/bin.

- If you run I2P using the i2prouter or runplain scripts, 
the wrapper.log is in /tmp and the other logs are in 
~/.i2p/logs. 

- If you run i2p with the initscript in /etc/init.d/i2p, 
all logs are written to /var/logs/i2p.

- runplain.sh is stored in /usr/share/doc/i2p/examples.
