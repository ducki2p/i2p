I2P source installation instructions

Prerequisites to build from source:
	Java SDK (preferably Oracle/Sun or OpenJDK) 1.6.0 or higher
          Non-linux operating systems and JVMs: See http://trac.i2p2.de/wiki/java
	Apache Ant 1.7.0 or higher
	Optional, For multilanguage support: The xgettext, msgfmt, and msgmerge tools installed
	from the GNU gettext package http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

To build and install I2P from source, you must first build
and package up the appropriate installer by running:

  ant pkg


This will produce a few key files:
* install.jar:    the GUI and console installer
* i2pinstall.exe: the GUI and console installer wrapped for cross-platform execution
* i2pupdate.zip:  the update package

From there, you can run the headless (console mode) installer:
  java -jar i2pinstall.exe -console

Or run the GUI installer:
  java -jar i2pinstall.exe

Or move the i2pupdate.zip file into an existing installation directory and restart.

To start I2P:
   (*nix): sh i2prouter start
   (win*): I2P.exe
   (non-x86 platforms PPC, ARM, etc): sh runplain.sh

To stop I2P (gracefully):
   lynx http://localhost:7657/summaryframe (click "Shutdown")

To stop I2P immediately:
   sh i2prouter stop

To uninstall I2P:
   rm -rf $I2PInstallDir ~/.i2p
